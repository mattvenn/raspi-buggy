# Raspberry pi scratch controlled drawing buggy

Simple buggy to control with scratch and python.

## Scratch 

A python listener is run on the raspberry pi which uses scratch's mesh networking capability to turn commands from scratch into motor controls.

Scratch itself is run on another computer to avoid the large overhead of sending graphics over the network.

## Python

The buggy can also be controlled direct from python.
